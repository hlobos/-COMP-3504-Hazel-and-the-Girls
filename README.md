### Project Description
DogWalkies allows dog owners to create a personal profile for their pet and reminds owners when their dog is in need of a walk.

Features of the app include keeping track of important pet information (such as last vet appointment) and general information (name, breed, and birthday) in an easy location. During a walk, owners can easily snap photos of their pooch and their journey. After the walk, owners can view their metrics and set when they would like to be reminded for another dog walk.
